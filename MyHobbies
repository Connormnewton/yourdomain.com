<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>Growing up I loved to be active and outdoors, whether that be pretending to fight off monsters with nerf swords when I was 8, to playing varsity sports in high school. I technically started playing sports in 6th grade, but a few non-sports related injuries kept me from playing a full season until 8th grade. That year I played soccer, ran indoor track, and played lacrosse. Once I got into high school, they rewarded three sport athletes with an “Iron Tiger,” a trophy in the shape of a tiger. I ended up getting two of them before I quit track because my friends stopped too and it was boring without them. Nowadays I don’t really play those sports actively but I will play soccer with my friends every now and again, and I really like to play tennis, I picked it up and it is incredibly fun.</p>
