<h1>Hello, my name is Connor Newton</h1>
<p>I am 19 years old, and my birthday is November 15, 1998. I was born at the Mercy Hospital in South Portland Maine at around 8 a.m. My name itself was not my mom’s first choice, she wanted Conrad or Levi however, my grandmother (her mother) suggested “Connor” and it stuck. I’ve moved around quite a bit in my life as I lived in South Portland for a few years, then I lived in Casco, right next to Naples, then in Gray, and in 6th grade I moved to Biddeford. I have lived in Biddeford from then up until August 2017, as I am now living in Orono, studying at the University of Maine.</p>
