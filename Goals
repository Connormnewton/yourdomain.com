<h1>My Goals For the Future</h1>
<p>When I graduate college, or even before then I hope to start my own clothing company. I intend to study brands like Supreme, who are a completely new company compared to other established businesses, but still manage to pull in ridiculous money for simple products. I would like to develop a clothing company that will be promoted through music artists because that is the best marketing possible in clothing today. I love designing clothes and streetwear fashion is awesome to me because it is so unique, people can wear things that donâ€™t match or seem odd on their own and make it work.  </p>
